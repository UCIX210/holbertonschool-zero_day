 # **üß†Learning Objectives**
* What is source code management
* What is Git
* What is GitHub
* What is the difference between Git and GitHub
* How to create a repository
* What is a README
* How to write good READMEs
* How to commit
* How to write helpful commit messages
* How to push code
* How to pull updates
* How to create a branch
* How to merge branches
* How to work as collaborators on a project
* Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo*

# **üõ†Requirements**
 * A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
 * A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. `git`), describing what this project is about
 * **Do not use GitHub‚Äôs web UI**, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won‚Äôt be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
 * Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else

# **üößTasks**
## **0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account**
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * File: `README.md`


## **1. Repo-session**
Create a new directory called `git` in your repo.
Make sure you include a not empty `README.md` in your directory:
* at the root of your repository
* AND in the directory `git`
And important part: **Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.**
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`

## **2. Coding fury road**
For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a `README.md`. It‚Äôs time to code!

* Create these directories at the root of your project: `bash`, `c`, `js`
* Create these empty files:
    * `c/c_is_fun.c`
    * `js/main.js`
    * `js/index.js`
* Create a file `bash/best` with these two lines inside: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "Best"`
* Create a file `bash/school` with these two lines inside: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "School"`
* Add all these new files to git
* Commit your changes (message: ‚ÄúStarting to code today, so cool‚Äù) and push to the remote server
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git
> * File: `bash/best, bash/school, c/c_is_fun.c, js/main.js, js/index.js`

## **3. Collaboration is the base of a company**
A branch is like a copy of your project. It‚Äôs used mainly for:

* adding a feature in development
* collaborating on the same project with other developers
* not breaking your entire repository
* not upsetting your co-workers

The purpose of a branch is to isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers‚Äô work.

For this project, create a branch `update_script` and in this branch:

* Create an empty file named `bash/98`
* Update `bash/best` by replacing `echo "Best"` with `echo "Best School"`
* Update `bash/school` by replacing `echo "School"` with `echo "The school is open!"`
* Add and commit these changes (message: ‚ÄúMy personal work‚Äù)
* Push this new branch [Tips](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)

Perfect! You did an amazing update in your project and it‚Äôs isolated correctly from the main branch.

Ho wait, your manager needs a quick fix in your project and it needs to be deployed now:

* Change branch to `main`
* Update the file `bash/best` by replacing `echo "Best"` with `echo "This School is so cool!"`
* Delete the directory `js`
* Commit your changes (message: ‚ÄúHot fix‚Äù) and push to the origin

Ouf, hot fix is done!
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git
> * File: `bash/best, bash/school, bash/98`

## **4. Collaboration: be up to date**
Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it‚Äôs best if you keep up to date with their changes.

For this task **‚Äì and only for this task ‚Äì** please update your file `README.md` in the main branch from GitHub.com. It‚Äôs the **only time** you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.

After you have done that, in your terminal:

* Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your `README.md` file will be updated)
* Create a new file `up_to_date` at the root of your directory and in it, write the git command line used
* Add `up_to_date` to git, commit (message: ‚ÄúHow to be up to date in git‚Äù), and push to the origin
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git
> * File: `README.md, up_to_date`

## **5. HAAA what did you do???**
Collaboration is cool, but not really when you update the same file at the same time‚Ä¶

To illustrate that, please merge the branch `update_script` to `main`: ‚ÄúCool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!‚Äù

**HHHHHHHAAAAAAAA**

```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bash/best
```
As you can see, you have conflicts between two branches on the same file.

Your goal now is to resolve conflicts by using the version of the branch `update_script`, and push the result to the origin.

At the end, you should have all your work from the branch `update_script` (new file and two updated files) and all latest `main` commits (new files, delete folder, etc.), without conflicts.
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git

## **6. Never push too much**
Create a `.gitignore` file and define a rule to never push ~ files (generated by Emacs). [Tips](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
> **Repo:**
> * GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-zero_day`
> * Directory: git
> * File: `.gitignore`
